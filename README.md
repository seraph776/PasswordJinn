## Overview 💡

This random password generator utilizes the [secrets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) module to generate a cryptographically strong and random password when you need it. It works by creating a password that includes a combinations of numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters between 8 and 32 characters in length. Each password is guaranteed to have a minimum of 1 unique character from each character set, and contain ALL UNIQUE characters.
